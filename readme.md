# Aetherhaven

Aetherhaven is a peaceful, top-down city and farm building game built with PyGame. Players start on a 100x100 map and expand infinitely by gathering resources (wood, gold, food) and constructing buildings. No combat. Focus is on growth, exploration, and empire-building.

## TO-DO

1. Basic PyGame window and main loop
2. Implement tile-based map (100x100 grid)
3. Add camera and map scrolling
4. Create player interaction: select/place buildings
5. Basic UI layout (resource counters, build menu)
6. Implement initial buildings (house, farm, lumber camp, mine)
7. Add resource gathering logic
8. Procedural map expansion system
9. Save/load game state
10. Improve art (placeholder to custom assets)
11. Add music and ambient sound
12. Performance optimizations
13. Polish UI and animations
14. Build packaging (installer or executable)
